##How to Contribute

 1. Fork this repo (you only have to fork once)
 2. **Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)**
 3. Stage your changes (`git add *`)
 4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'add some feature'`)
 5. Push your feature branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
 6. Create new pull request

##How to fetch changes from original repo to yours (do this every day before you make any new feature branches):
1. In your command line, type **Git remote add upstream** and git@github.com:AsaSmith/bsomethingmore.git or https://github.com/AsaSmith/bsomethingmore.git.
2. Git fetch upstream
3. Git checkout master
4. Git merge upstream/master
5. Git push origin master
Your repo on github should now match bsomethingmore's.

##How to merge a pull request...only merge the pull requests of other authors, never your own.
1. go to the pull request on bsomethingmore in github.
2. Click the merge pull request button. If there are conflicts move to step 3.
3. Click the command line instructions link to merge conflicts.
4. Follow step 1 in your command line.
5. Stop and open the project in your text editor before doing step 2.
6. Make necessary edits on the feature branch, save the file, then commit your changes to that branch.
7. Move to step 2 and complete instructions.
8. Git push upstream master. (this will update the bsomethingmore repo as well as your own.)

Your repo and the bsomethhingmore repo should match.

##Homework
I know we have all have a lot going on but I thought it might be a good idea for us to get to know what our goals are for this project. This homework will also be helpful with the git workflow (pulls, branching, commit, push, merge requests, and issues etc). It would be awesome if we could do this by the next time we meet, but I understand that might not be possible with our schedules.

1. Go to the git hub [bsomethingmore](https://github.com/AsaSmith/bsomethingmore) repo and create an issue. Make the title your name.
2. Pull/Fetch the most current repo (merge with your master if necessary)
3. Create feature branch, checkout feature branch
4. Open the README.md file
5. Add your name as an h3 below the "Goals"
6. Below your name write a few sentences explaining what your goals are or what you're hoping to get out of this project
7. Save file, stage changes, commit changes(add your issue \# to your commit message e.g. 'homework complete \#2'), push branch
8. Any questions, use the slack channel
9. Have fun!
